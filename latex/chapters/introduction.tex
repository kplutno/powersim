The purpose of the study was to create a mathematical model of the phenomena occurring during the production of electricity
from renewable energy sources. The data used in the work concerned the national electric power system. An important element of the 
of the work was the use of weather forecasts with high accuracy, which allowed a comprehensive analysis of energy production.
